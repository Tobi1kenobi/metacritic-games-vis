They created one of the defining titles of the current generation and a technical marvel whose stunning beauty in motion words cannot describe. And there’s one more thing. Barlog’s touching reaction to his masterpiece’s scores shows that even in the world of huge budgets, micropayments, loot boxes and sales forecasts there still is a place for artists who pour their hearts into their work. We need someone to remind us of that once in a while. [06/2018, p.38]',\n",

God of War is brilliant in ways I never thought games could be. That it’s also perhaps the most highly polished game I’ve ever played, with unsurpassed presentation and mechanics, is actually secondary to the fact that it generated in me the kind of childlike awe I haven’t experienced in decades. I have been writing about video games for almost 20 years now, and in all that time I have never given any game a perfect score. Until now.',\n",

Kratos becomes a hurricane of death and destruction, blocking, shield bashing, slicing, dicing, spinning around and throwing his axe at an enemy further away, while pummeling closer monsters with punches and kicks, and then recalling the weapon to catch two more draugr in the back, before going in for one of the several spectacular finishers. It’s fast, complex, addictive, and exhilarating, but I never once felt like I wasn’t in control.',\n",

Kratos’ fighting has been refined to its very best and the lands of Midgard are filled with wonders of all manner to explore and defeat. It’s been nearly the entire lifespan of the PlayStation 4 console since Kratos has seen new adventure but the wait has been worth it. Santa Monica Studio’s journey is still far from over, but they’ve once again shown why Kratos is one of gaming’s greatest anti-heroes.',\n",

Instead, Santa Monica Studio has given the franchise the treatment it deserves. This new narrative tone has heart, and serves to make Kratos much more relatable in his new role as protector, while remaining as brutal as past installments. Reworked and improved combat options make for an enjoyable and customizable experience, and phenomenal audiovisual performance ensures that each trip to the mythical lands before the Vikings is a wonderfully grisly experience. God of War is a must-buy experience well worth the wait.',\n",

This reimagining of the famous PlayStation franchise elevates the series in unexpected ways, without forgetting the core tenets that made Kratos a fan-favourite to begin with.

But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.',\n",

Here, you won’t find a list of watchtowers to visit, outposts to clear, swarms of respawning enemies to kill. Not to mention that side-quests are far better than typical “kill 10 somethings” stuff.

And playing on PS4 Pro on a setup like my Samsung QLED 65” Q8C with HDR, it just screams quality.',\n",
       " 'LevelUp': 'God of War is all you can ask from a new game in a franchise; very high production values, charismatic characters and satisfying combat, visceral with no lack of action. However, this is accompanied by a very well-told story, excellent animation, a very interesting new universe, fun gameplay and a partner that develops a very promising personality. You can feel the dedication and care that Santa Monica Studio put into every frame of this game. Despite going in a new direction, God of War somehow manages to feel familiar and it is a worthy beginning of a new saga that surely has a lot to give us in the future.',\n",
       " 'Game Informer': 'Kratos’ reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series’ evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.',\n",
       " 'Atomix': 'PlayStation boasts a new and wonderful exclusive that will be difficult to match and, of course, it seems that it gives way to a new saga within the wonderful universe of Kratos. It is not enough to be ambitious. The most important thing is to know how to land those ambitions.',\n",

He can only stay Old Testament-angry for so long, and the table is definitely set for more installments.

Everything new it does is for the better, and everything it holds onto benefits as a result. Kratos is no longer a predictable brute. God of War is no longer an old-fashioned action series. With this reboot, it confidently walks a new path that will hopefully lead to more exciting adventures to come.\",\n",

As a result, God of War can feel slightly homogenised in a way that some fans may find unappealing. Thankfully, a strong sense of setting and brutally satisfying combat help maintain that God of War identity. If it wasn't made abundantly clear already, this is the first in what will most likely be a new trilogy for the God of War franchise, and this first instalment serves as a pretty great foundation.\",\n",
       " 'Twinfinite': \"Despite all my complaints about Atreus and the game's imperfections, this is still an easy game to recommend to anyone with a PS4. God of War marks the glorious and bloody return of everyone's favorite Spartan, and with the new dive into Norse mythology, there's still plenty of adventures to look forward to as the series evolves.\",\n",
       " 'British GQ': 'It’s bravura game-making – a single-shot production that extends across 30-or-more hours, boasting some peerless direction and wonderful performances. The cinematic decision to keep everything in one continuous shot, the camera constantly in motion, means you never leave Kratos’ side. It’s a choice that makes for the most personal God Of War to date, perhaps the most personal game of its kind.',\n",
       " 'CNET': \"God of War is a staggering achievement in gaming -- the sort of must-play title that we only we get two or three times in a console's lifespan.\",\n",
       " 'Eurogamer': 'Despite eye-catching changes, the heart of this series remains gloriously unaltered. [Recommended]',\n",
       " 'Kotaku': 'It feels like more of a trend follower than a trendsetter, a pastiche of ideas. But they are good ideas, done well enough to bring a once-stale series back up from the depths of Helheim.',\n",
       " 'Mashable': \"The shortcomings do little to mar the overall experience, and most only become evident after you've spent 30 or 40 hours in this dazzling world. God of War is a special game. It's the sort of experience that people are going to be talking about for months to come, with a story that hits you right in the feels and smooth, beautifully staged gameplay that clicks immediately like a familiar, old friend.\",\n",
       " 'The A.V. Club': 'It’s a surprisingly emotional story for one of gaming’s most emotionally stunted characters, told with care and wrapped in a production that’s a flat-out technical marvel, visually spectacular from start to finish and captured with an omnipresent, unflinching camera that makes it look unlike anything we’ve seen before.',\n",
       " 'The Jimquisition': \"It's pretty good, I'll say that much. I don't think it's the most brilliant game in the world. It's not having me crying tears of joy. But it's nice to play a game with a sense of a beginning, middle, and end, a game with a sense of pacing. A game that does have its open explore able areas...It's just nice to play a game that feels like a game, more than a service.\",\n",
       " 'The Verge': 'On their own, the various elements that make up God of War don’t sound especially unique or interesting. But it’s the way they work together — how the story informs the action and vice versa — that makes it memorable. God of War takes a one-dimensional series and turns it into something with depth and emotion.',\n",
       " 'Time': 'The new God of War is a departure from its predecessors that gives the player more without making any compromises. It’s challenging, beautiful, brutal, rewarding, and even a bit funny on occasion. Whether you’re a fan of the series or not, it’s well worth your time.',\n",
       " 'Variety': 'Kratos remains capable of startling violence. But there is a sense that even Sony Santa Monica has recoiled from some of “God of War’s” legacy, and the game is better for it. It is a game that treats its history with respect where appropriate, but without obligation, even in its very concluding moments. This new God of War has some rough edges remaining in its transition to something new, but even in its concluding moments, it commits to its vision in a way that few games do — and it’s the first time the series has felt vibrant and important in a decade.',\n",
       " 'VG247': 'God of War has grown up. It is violent, but it’s not excessive. It is angry, but there is something to contrast it against. There is a flash of nipple, but it’s Kratos’s. Kratos is older, and he feels remorse for his past, but it feels like Sony Santa Monica also wants to atone. If that was God of War’s goal, the studio deserves a standing ovation. This isn’t only the best God of War game, it’s one of the best games of the current generation.'}"

      "Video games have almost always looked at Hollywood for inspiration. Gaming has been been fixated on emulating the silver screen’s cinematography and storytelling techniques as the medium strives to be taken more seriously. The Just Cause series, on the other hand, hasn’t studied narrative as hard but rather the explosive set pieces that make up most blockbusters. Avalanche Studios has been implementing more and more tools with each successive installment to make the moment-to-moment gameplay more evocative of an explosive action movie that you can play. JUST CAUSE 4 is the natural zenith of that mentality as its newly expanded toolset gives players the freedom to goof off in the huge sandbox in a way that few games can match. The grappling hook is vital component of Just Cause 4’s huge push towards player choice. Instead of only tethering objects together, it can now attach balloons and rocket boosters to almost anything in the world. On the surface, it’s hilarious to toss seven balloons and three rockets on a car and watch it spin around at Mach 4 but it goes so much deeper. Each of the three components has a dizzying array of options that allow for a nearly overwhelming amount of customization. Unlockable mods change how the three behave and can be activated instantly or through holding down or pressing a button. For example, you can set the balloons to follow your reticle, inflate on a button press, and to explode when destroyed while having the rocket boosters only fire upwards, thrust quickly at an extreme speed, and activate only when the button is held down.  When combined in the right ways, this breathtaking number of options gives you a command over the environment in way that leads to constant discovery. When combined in the wrong ways, this incredible array of options is hilarious as your engineering failures—combined with the random parts of the open world—are always unscripted comedy gold. And almost everything can be manipulated, moved, or propelled into space at your whim and the tools give you that freedom to have better control over the mayhem inherent to the series, granted you can get over the learning curve. Something productive, clever, funny, or a combination of the three is almost always possible if you can just think of how to combine the tools in a way to make it a reality. Objectives hardly force you to craft solutions but are often open enough to silently invite your creativity in different ways. Just Cause 4 is usually pretty unrestrictive so you can create a flying tank equipped with balloons and boosters or use nearby metal shipping containers to create impromptu protective barriers in almost any general activity. But there are times where both story and side objectives will task you with moving an object or vehicle to a certain area, which is where the game pushes you to utilize its toolset in whatever way you see fit. Freeform objectives don’t grow stale because there’s always some new contraption to think up and different plan to execute. And that sense of newness snowballs as you spend more time with the tools and string together more elaborate methods of achieving the same goals. Although some missions could better facilitate the game’s bombastic nature. Grappling around and using the wingsuit is still a joy because of how it makes normal traversal actively engaging as well as how it turns you into an agile Ethan Hunt version of Spider-Man. You feel like what every Mission Impossible movie looks like. But not as many of the main missions push these mechanics to their limit in clever ways not possible in the open world. They end up being more of what you see in the other parts of the game: zipping around and blowing things up in clever ways. Thus, campaign missions thrive off the incredible strength of the core mechanics yet still could have been pushed just a bit further with more memorable specialized scenarios. Side missions use the sandbox well in the same ways but also drag on and rely too heavily on hacking and defending people or objects. Missions have a greater variety this time around and somehow still usually revolve around watching a meter slowly fill up.  The extreme weather is similarly great yet underutilized. There’s either a sandstorm, a tornado, or thunderstorm that roams around one specific on the map. Each is another random variable in the game’s toolbag that can hinder or help you as you roam around. The tornado is especially impressive in how it whips everything around every which way—yourself included. But while these impressive feats of nature are always looming, they’re hardly in the game outside of the missions where you “fight” them. Constantly running into these storms and seeing their destruction firsthand would have made you see for yourself why they needed to be stopped. And also it’s just a ton of fun to fling guards into the tornado. Just Cause 4’s structure, like its gameplay, is also quite open. The three chunks of the story can be tackled in any order right from the start. It’s oddly refreshing to see an open-world game give the player almost complete and utter freedom. Some campaign missions do require clearing specific bases but it’s more relaxed than other games in the genre that either hold the player’s hand for too long or gate off certain areas with higher leveled enemies. It’s on brand for a Just Cause game to be open but it’s also on brand for the series to have a weak narrative. Returning protagonist Rico Rodriguez has come to the fictional country of Solís to stop its evil leader and his ludicrous weather-based death machines. Toppling dictators is Rico’s reason for getting up in the morning but the story never reaches the goofy, self-aware heights of its past nor becomes a genuinely compelling drama in and of itself. Lighthearted, well-acted cutscenes and a handful of funny lines make the simple story easy to follow and keep it moving at a decent pace. Although it lacks a sense of grander purpose. Carving the story into separate chunks helps the gameplay pacing but it kills any arc the characters would have since each can be completed in any order. Both villains also hardly have any screen time as they only show up at the beginning and end. The story contains whispers of Rico outgrowing his parody persona and hints at a deeper look into his family but it’s all left in the margins at the behest of the action. It’s the right choice, given the game, but it didn’t have to be a choice.  Just Cause 3 had a worse narrative but it was more notorious for how technically broken it was. Just Cause 4 actually functions this time like a finished video game since it maintains a relatively stable frame rate in most cases and only has a few, short load times. Some odd lighting shows up in the cutscenes and an abundance of motion blur can lead to some visual mishaps but Just Cause 4, for the most part, seems like an apology for the poor performance of its predecessor. However, while not in the game yet, Avalanche Studios has promised to patch in better lighting and motion blur options. But it’s also just snappier in general. Choosing side activities is a breeze and doesn’t even require that you pause the game or go through a long load; a seamless process that other games should take and improve upon. Menus are quite dense but make navigation easy, which is helpful when sifting through the many grappling hook customization options or the on-demand supply drops. Fixing technical issues does wonders for making it feel complete, but these other quality of life changes result in a smoother, more pleasant overall package. Just Cause 4 fulfills the promise of what a Just Cause game should be better than any of its predecessors. Those titles laid the groundwork but Just Cause 4 has taken that foundation and tossed enough boosters and balloons on it to ride it into the stratosphere to its natural apex. The embarrassing wealth of flexible tools foster a sense of freedom, creativity, and stupidity that most open-world games only pretend to have. It’s Bayhem, gamified even down to the poor narrative. But the game also lets you become Michael Bay by giving you total control over the chaos you can create on the screen. That may not be a flattering comparison in the cinematic world but for a game like Just Cause 4, it’s one of the highest compliments. Just Cause 4 was reviewed on PS4 via a digital code provided by the publisher. \n"

       " 'ZTGD': 'I could do all of those things, but I’d rather just say that GTA V is as close to a perfection of the Grand Theft Auto formula as has been created thus far. If you have any interest at all, it should already be installing on your system.',\n",
       " 'Games.cz': \"At first sight just another well-executed GTA game, which is by itself a great excuse for our ultimate rating. When you look at it for a second time, you'll get the incredibly immersive and entertaining world that will not let you free. There are flaws indeed. But you know what? When you love it nothing else matters.\",\n",
       " 'Game Revolution': \"Rockstar Games have unleashed the Skyrim of third-person action games. It'll have a lasting impact through controversy, through harshly addictive gameplay, and by taking the zeitgeist of 18-36 year-old males hostage and torturing them with nipple clamps.\",\n",
       " 'LevelUp': 'With Grand Theft Auto V Rockstar has delivered one of the most amazing and awe-inspiring games of this generation. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the incredible level of detail, the three main character switching mechanic, the bank heists and the hilarious story make this game a must.',\n",
       " 'EGM': 'Grand Theft Auto V expertly blends the best aspects of the last two major releases in the series, GTA IV and San Andreas, to set a new standard in open-world action. In a year already packed with titles that have pushed aging console hardware to new extremes, GTA V might stand as the crowning technical and design accomplishment.',\n",
       " 'X-ONE Magazine UK': 'GTA V is funny, genuinely laugh out loud funny – and not in a ’shoving a ten-inch purple dildo up your arse’ funny – the humour is told through situation, through incredibly clever writing and wonderful sense of place. Really, that says everything you need to know about GTA V. Rockstar has spent five years, and an insane amount of money, building a game that is not only bold enough to step away from expectation, but brave enough to revel in its combined history as well.',\n",
       " 'Gameplanet': \"Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of the franchise and of gaming in 2013. A ridiculously ambitious title that wrings absolutely everything out of the aging seventh-gen consoles, it's a spectacular triumph in every conceivable way. Rejoice, for Rockstar North has done it again.\",\n",
       " 'God is a Geek': 'Make no mistake: this game is beyond heavyweight. In many ways, Grand Theft Auto V is a culmination of the current generation; it’s a summation of everything we’ve seen in the last eight years, a love letter, if you like, to the 360 and the PS3.',\n",
       " 'Telegraph': 'Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of open-world video game design and a colossal feat of technical engineering. It takes a template laid down by its predecessors and expands upon it, improving on and streamlining some of its rougher aspects. It doesn’t break out of that template and can be brash, nasty and nihilistic. But for all its more unsavoury aspects, this is a game built with skilled mechanical expertise and creative artistry.',\n",
       " 'Guardian': 'The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead...The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you.',\n",
       " 'SpazioGames': \"When analyzed in its purest essence, GTA V not only proves to be an excellent title, but also a game that is able to make a sublime parody of today's society, taking advantage of all the excesses and insanities to which the world is slowly getting used.\",\n",

I never felt like I didn’t have something to do and as of right now, I’m going right back in to do it all over again. I’ve been with GTA since the beginning way back in ‘97, and it feels like GTA V is the culmination of everything we love about the series: It’s big, it’s pretty, and most importantly it’s just nonstop fun.',\n",

Previous lengths have been traded in for a consistently captivating narrative which not only holds everything together, but really makes this game seem more than the sum of its parts. The only remaining question is: Where will – or can –the series go from here? I am looking forward to finding out.',\n",

The story is beautiful, the graphics are unbelievable for the old hardware they run on, and most importantly the gameplay is fun and smooth. GTA V is not afraid to show it is a videogame, and has the guts to trade some of its realism for the sake of fun.',\n",

If all the other studious could do what Rockstar can, there'd be plenty of life left in the current console generation. But that's the thing, isn't it. No other developer is like Rockstar. And no other series is like Grand Theft Auto.\",\n",

       " 'VideoGamer': \"Unless you play it for yourself, it's near impossible to grasp how big GTA 5 is. It's not just the world. It's the gargantuan story, the sheer amount of missions and the variety introduced with them, the activities to take part in, or the secrets waiting to be unveiled. It's a highlight of the generation.\",\n",
       " 'Hardcore Gamer': 'It features arguably the best story of the series that’s greatly enhanced by the added dynamic of three contrasting protagonists.',\n",
       " 'IGN': 'Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago.',\n",
       " 'Official Xbox Magazine': 'From skydiving and submarine exploration to bounty-hunting and watching animated shorts, GTA V is absolutely crammed full of things to do, and it looks amazing while you do them.',\n",
       " 'Official Xbox Magazine UK': \"Rockstar's Xbox 360 swansong is probably the console's greatest technical achievement, and as such it's unmissable.\",\n",
       " 'The Globe and Mail (Toronto)': 'Is Grand Theft Auto V the best game of the year? Easily. Is it the best game of this current generation of consoles? Definitely – and it’s quite possibly the best video game yet. I say this after playing it for “only” 20 hours.',\n",
       " 'Edge Magazine': 'No one makes worlds like Rockstar, but at last it has produced one without compromise. Everything works. It has mechanics good enough to anchor games of their own, and a story that is not only what GTA has always wanted to tell but also fits the way people have always played it. It’s a remarkable achievement, a peerless marriage of world design, storytelling and mechanics that pushes these ageing consoles to the limit and makes it all look easy.',\n",
       " 'Gamer.no': 'Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best sandboxes that video games have to offer. Where massive worlds often are plagued by boring missions and lifeless areas, Rockstar has managed to make an incredibly engaging game that still retains a humongous and lively world.',\n",
       " 'Giant Bomb': 'The writing associated with those main characters and their stories is the best part of Grand Theft Auto V.',\n",
       " 'MondoXbox': 'There’s no better time than this to use the word masterwork: Rockstar did a colossal job creating a huge, visually stunning world chiseled in its finest details, populated by brilliant characters and with highly spectacular and varied gameplay.',\n",
       " 'Games Master UK': \"No game can match its mix of scale, direction and quality - and we don't know when one might. [Dec 2013, p.52]\",\n",
       " 'COGconnected': 'The world of Grand Theft Auto V is undeniably a masterpiece and has set a very high bar for sandbox gaming not only for this generation but for the next gen which is so closely upon us. Beyond the game’s story line you’ll be able to put in hundreds of hours just wandering the city streets and never be bored doing so.',\n",
       " 'Gaming Nexus': 'Rockstar Games has managed to exceed my expectations and create one of the best games of this generation.',\n",
       " 'ActionTrip': 'Grand Theft Auto 5 defines what we want out of a free-roam action game. It also outshines all of its predecessors in every possible way, because it perfects the familiar formula and takes it to new heights.',\n",
       " 'GameTrailers': 'For the anarchist, GTA5 is quite a playground. The entire map is available once you get through an hour or so of the story, and the tools of destruction are numerous and hugely enjoyable, although some of them might need to be unlocked first. The Gatling gun returns and a gas canister spills a solid line of flammable justice waiting to be set off. Guns can be painted up and modded with flashlights, grips, scopes, and suppressors.',\n",
       " 'AusGamers': 'The standout factor for Grand Theft Auto V is that each character not only offers a unique perspective on the GTA world in which you’re taking part, but on gaming as a whole. Franklin is new to the ‘game’ -- he looks sharp and listens and learns. Michael is as I’ve painted him to be: a reluctant master in an ever-changing dojo clinging to a wall of arbitrary yet important-to-him trophies, while Trevor is the wild side in every gamer (thanks Joab) -- the sort of yes-man we inevitably become because pain and reward exist on a blurred precipice in modern narrative-driven gaming.',\n",
       " 'Game Informer': \"The narrative fails to match the impact John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but the colorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless. Like the golden state it parodies, Grand Theft Auto V is filled with beautiful scenery, a wealth of activities, and the promise of fortune.\",\n",
       " \"Gamers' Temple\": \"GTA V continues the game series' tradition of raising the bar for open world action games.\",\n",
       " 'Armchair Empire': 'Tons of gameplay hours, plenty of missions and activities with an awesome collection of vehicles of various modes of transportation and a large array of firearms put the grandeur once again into Grand Theft Auto.',\n",
       " 'Game Over Online': 'GTA5’s main single player story mode delivers the best Grand Theft Auto experience to date.',\n",
       " 'Pelit (Finland)': 'Even a die-hard detractor of the Grand Theft Auto series (yes, that\\'s me) is forced to admit that \"V\" is one sweet game. In fact, it\\'s one of the best of this generation. [Oct 2013]',\n",
       " 'GamingTrend': 'I can’t imagine the pressure behind the scenes, but everything that Rockstar has attempted with Grand Theft Auto V gels together perfectly. As we look forward to the next-generation launches in just a few months, it’s pretty awesome to see the best game of this entire generation cap it off.',\n",
       " 'Polygon': \"Rockstar has expanded and improved upon so much of what's special about video games as mainstream spectacles, from the playful use of characters to the refined take on world design. The developer's progress makes the aspects of the game left in cultural stasis — the poorly drawn women, the empty cynicism, the unnecessarily excessive cruelty — especially agitating.\",\n",
       " 'Riot Pixels': 'The most amazing thing about this criminal saga is not only its scale, but that it perfectly works on several levels. Spine-tingling driving, fun missions, excellent dialogue, fully fleshed characters, vicious satire on pretty much everything… One play-through is not enough to appreciate GTA 5 in all its multi-layered glory.',\n",
       " 'Toronto Sun': 'Its problems range from finicky little things like twitchy helicopter flying controls to much larger issues, such as unsettling bits of cruelty that don’t always register as satire, or the still-unsolved challenge of maintaining any sense of plot urgency in a game where players are free to abandon the storyline and spend hours skyjacking blimps, tooling around in a submarine or taking in-game smartphone selfies and posting them online.',\n",
       " 'Critical Hit': 'Despite all these accomplishments and additions though, GTA V isn’t a huge leap forward for Rockstar. Instead, it’s an evolution of all their previous work, all combined into one sandbox experience on a massive scale. But it’s a satisfying path that the franchise has taken, kicking other genre games off the throne that it helped build.',\n",
       " 'Gamer Limit': 'Although it does suffer from a few problems that have plagued the franchise since the beginning, the improved driving controls, captivating leads, and the sprawling city of Los Santos should win the hearts of any open world fan out there.',\n",
       " 'Joystiq': 'An ambitious game, attempting to meld three very different characters together to tell one encompassing story of survival in what amounts to the worst place in America. That story stumbles, but the open-ended gameplay remains a showpiece for the vast amount of content that can be poured into a virtual world.',\n",
       " 'Destructoid': \"All three characters, in their respective ways, feel representative of the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole, and contribute to making GTA V what it is -- the ultimate culmination of Rockstar's beloved and despised series.\",\n",
       " 'Post Arcade (National Post)': 'When you’re dealing with disturbing subjects ranging from life-destroying drug addiction to creepy cult organizations to legitimately psychopathic behaviour, the jokes go down a little easier if you get the sense that the writers penned their quips with an aim to make you think about why you’re laughing...True satire happens in Grand Theft Auto V, just not nearly as often as I’d like.',\n",
       " 'Level7.nu': 'Grand Theft Auto V offers one of the best sandbox experiences ever,\\r\\nfilled to the brink with stuff to do. The vistas are magnificent and\\r\\namazing stuff just seems to happen wherever you go. But at the same\\r\\ntime the story is tired and the characters unoriginal. Your\\r\\nappreciation of Grand Theft Auto V will depend of what you want out of\\r\\nthe series. The freedom and joy of discovery is hard to beat but\\r\\nthe rest still has some ways left to go.',\n",
       " 'GameCritics': \"Even with as many downs as ups, Grand Theft Auto V is still a significant achievement in design. Playing missions from multiple perspectives is a creative spark that will surely light up the next generation, and I'm confident the Housers have even bigger ambitions. They'll keep building upon this template and inch tantalizingly closer to creating their perfect game. GTA5 isn't it, but its flashes of brilliance will endure.\"}"
